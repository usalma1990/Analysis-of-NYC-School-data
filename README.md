# Analysis-of-NYC-School-data
In real-world data science projects, data often has to be aggregated from disparate sources and data cleaning has to be done before we can do any analysis and modeling work.
In this , we'll go through the first part of a complete data science project which begins with the acquisition of raw data. The primary focus in this project will be on data acquisition, preparation, cleaning and aggregation followed by exploratory data analyis. 
We will combine several messy data sets into a single clean one before commencing analysis. For this project, we'll be using data about New York City public schools.

Using Correlations Analysis

In New York State, Regents Examinations are statewide standardized examinations in core high school subjects required for a certain Regents Diploma to graduate. For higher achieving students, a Regents with Advanced designation, and an Honor designation, are also offered.

The percentage of Grad students taking Non-Advanced Regents Exams at a school increases.

The higher the number of SAT test takers at a school, the higher the SAT Score Avg. for that school. This implies that as the number of SAT test takers at a school increases, each individual student tends to score relatively higher which in turn leads to a higher SAT Score Avg. for that school.

As the average class size at a school increases, SAT Score Avg. also tends to increase for that school.
